When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are working on a collaboration project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In case you are currently working on a specific feature and you want your
    environment to be free of any external changes for the time being. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones but in userspace from one git repository to another.
    Clones are a mirror of a working repository which can be remote -> local
    or local -> local.
    Branches are a different segment in one repository.
    Forks can be used for collaborations. Clones can be used for local
    collaborations not in a centralized repository. Branches are to work on
    different features etc and can exist asynchronously with the former two 
    concepts. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    In case you are leaving the grid for a period of time, then it would be nice
    to have the most recent code in the repository and then merge after you have
    completed work offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would probably use some sort of feature rich chat software such as slack 
    or something. I think being able to talk in real time has its benefits but
    it lacks version control.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
